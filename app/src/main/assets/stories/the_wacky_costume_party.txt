{SPS_1_1} The Wacky Costume Party

Do you like wearing costumes and pretending to be somebody different? The spelling kids really do, and enjoyed the goofiest, silliest, craziest, wackiest mixed-up costume party -- ever! And had their pets dress up too! The only rule was-- no... scary... costumes. Some kids dressed like a [X-1,3,5,6,7] {SPS_1_2} or [Y-1,3,5,6,7] {SPS_1_3} or [Z-1,3,5,6,7] {SPS_1_4} ,but the spelling kids shared and traded different costume parts so their pets all looked really strange and weird and kind of especially -- wondersome! Except -- [C-2] {SPS_1_5} didn't plan to mean to intend to break the rule, or be really naughty, just maybe a tiny bit mischievous, so [C] {SPS_1_6} convinced [C] {SPS_1_7} it would be okay if the costume wasn't scary all by itself, only just scary if people decided to be frightened, and if people decide to, [C] {SPS_1_8} decided that [C] {SPS_1_9} wasn't to blame. Uh-hunh.
[D-2] {SPS_1_10} went to the party dressed as a [D-1,3] {SPS_1_11} , and brought a pet [E-H] {SPS_1_12} who looked very interesting with a [E-M] {SPS_1_13} body and a [E-T] {SPS_1_14} tail.
[G-2] {SPS_1_15} came costumed as a [G-1,3] {SPS_1_16} , and had a pet [J-H] {SPS_1_17} who looked great with a [J-T] {SPS_1_18} tail and a [J-M] {SPS_1_19} middle.
[K-2] {SPS_1_20} thought and wondered and cogitated and finally decided to be a [K-1,3] {SPS_1_21} , and brought a strange pet [L-H] {SPS_1_22} with [L-M] {SPS_1_23} tummy parts and a [L-T] {SPS_1_24} tail part. And a wonderful time was had by all -- until [C] {SPS_1_25} appeared in a Bigfoot Sasquatch costume!
Which didn't scare [D] {SPS_1_26} or [G-2] {SPS_1_27} or [K-2] {SPS_1_28} -- they didn't decide to be frightened -- but those poor pets didn't know they could decide, and just got howlishously scared without even thinking about it! The [E-H E-M E-T] {SPS_1_29} spilled the fruit punch bowl and the [J-H J-M J-T] {SPS_1_30} tumbled into the big party chocolate angel-food cake and the [L-H L-M L-T] {SPS_1_31} knocked over the treats table and in all the commotion [D] {SPS_1_32} hid behind the [N-8,9] {SPS_1_33} , and [G] {SPS_1_34} peeeeked out of the [P-8,9] {SPS_1_35} , and [K] {SPS_1_36} sneaked under the [Q-8,9] {SPS_1_37} , and when the grown-ups rushed in [C] {SPS_1_38} thought it was a very good time to hide in a costume, only maybe not in a Bigfoot Sasquatch costume. And the grownups made [C] {SPS_1_39} keep that costume on and do all the work all alone to wipe up the fruit punch and clean up the spilled cake and tidy up the treats table. And [C] {SPS_1_40} decided not to decide again that it would be okay fun to decide to scare anybody, whether they decided to be scared or not.
