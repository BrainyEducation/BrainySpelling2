{}Do you like wearing costumes {}and pretending to be somebody different?
{}The spelling kids really do, {}and enjoyed the {}goofiest, {}silliest, {}craziest, {}wackiest
{}mixed-up costume party -- ever! {}And had their pets dress up too! {}The only rule
was--{}no... scary... costumes. {}Some kids dressed like a [1,3,5,6,7] {}or
[1,3,5,6,7] {}or [1,3,5,6,7], {}but the spelling kids shared {}and traded different
costume parts {}so their pets all looked really strange {}and weird {}and kind of
especially -- {}wondersome! {}Except -- [2] {}didn't plan to mean to
intend to break the rule, {}or be really naughty, {}just maybe a tiny bit mischievous,
so [2] {}convinced [2] {}it would be okay if the costume wasn't scary all by itself,
{}only just scary if people decided to be frightened, {}and if people decide to, [2]
{}decided that [2] {}wasn't to blame. {}Uh-hunh.

[2] {}went to the party dressed as a [1,3], {}and brought a pet
[H] {}who looked very interesting with a [M] {}body and a [T] {}tail.

[2] {}came costumed as a [1,3], {}and had a pet [H] {}who looked great
with a [T] {}tail and a [M] {}middle.

[2] {}thought {}and wondered {}and cogitated {}and finally decided to be a [1,3],
{}and brought a strange pet [H] {}with [M] {}tummy parts and a [T] {}tail part.

{}And a wonderful time was had by all -- {}until [2] {}appeared in a {}Bigfoot
Sasquatch costume!

{}Which didn't scare [2] {}or [2] {}or [2] -- {}they didn't decide to be
frightened -- {}but those poor pets didn't know they could decide, {}and just got
howlishously scared {}without even thinking about it! The [HMT] {}spilled the
fruit punch bowl and the [HMT] {}tumbled into the big party chocolate angel-
food cake and the [HMT] {}knocked over the treats table {}and in all the
commotion [2] {}hid behind the [8,9], {}and [2] {}peeeeked out of the [8,9],
{}and [2] {}sneaked under the [8,9], {}and when the grown-ups rushed in [2]
{}thought it was a very good time to hide in a costume, {}only maybe not in a Bigfoot
Sasquatch costume. {}And the grownups made [2] {}keep that costume on {}and do
all the work all alone {}to wipe up the fruit punch {}and clean up the spilled cake {}and
tidy up the treats table. And [2] {}decided not {}to decide again {}that it would be
okay fun {}to decide to scare anybody, {}whether {}they {}decided {}to {}be {}scared {}or {}not.
