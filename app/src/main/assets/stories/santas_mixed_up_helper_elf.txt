{SPS_3_1} Santa's Mixed-Up Helper Elf

Late one Christmas Eve, frazzled and exhausted and sleepy-tired more than ever, poor shy Elmer, one of Santa's helper-elves, began climbing into his top bunk-bed bed when a paper stuck in his sleeve fluttered at his wrist. Uh-oh. He checked. Uh-oh. A list of toys he'd forgotten to pack up in Santa's sleigh. A mother had written and mailed to Santa the list for her children at a homeless shelter, a place families go when they can't stay in their own home any more and don't have any place else to go. Staying there means they don't have much room, and usually can't bring more than just one little toy. The letter she sent for them to Santa said that [A-2] {SPS_3_2} wanted first a soft fluffy stuffed [D-5,6,7] {SPS_3_3} little enough to carry anywhere, and second a wooden [E-5,6,7,10,13] {SPS_3_4} big enough to sit and rock on and pretend to ride far away. The first request for [B-2] {SPS_3-5} was a [G-10] {SPS_3-6} like nobody else's, and second a battery powered remote control [J-13] {SPS_3-7} to race across the floor and under chairs and tables and maybe chase a cat or scare-bump somebody's shoes from behind. [C-2] {SPS_3-8} wanted most a brand new [K-12,5,6,7,10] {SPS_3-9} to show off and look pretty with, and a pretty white sweater with a picture of her very favorite animal, a [L-5,6,7] {SPS_3-10} . Timid helper-elf Elmer felt terribly, horribly awful that he'd found the list so late and quickly raced around Santa's big toy warehouse to gather the gifts, but poor Elmer's sleepy eyes didn't read the list's words very well, and poor Elmer's sleepy memory didn't remember very well, and --oh no!-- at the very last minute poor timid Elmer had mistakenly loaded into Santa's sleigh
--for [A] {SPS_3-11} -uh oh-a soft fluffy stuffed little [R-5,6,7] {SPS_3-12} to carry and a big wooden [S-5,6,7,10,13] {SPS_3-13} to ride,
--for [B] {SPS_3-14} -uh uh oh-an RC [V-13] {SPS_3-15} and [W-10] {SPS_3-16} ,
--for [C] {SPS_3-17} -oh no-one [X-12,5,6,7,10] {SPS_3-18} and a pink sweater with a [Y-5,6,7] {SPS_3-19} .
Santa, just a tiny bit late as usual, loudly called out 'Hi Ho' and his team of reindeer swooshed off into the sky just at the very moment when poor timid Elmer looked at that list one more time--uh oh-- and discovered --oh no!-- he had made a mistake on every ... single ... gift. Elmer crumpled down on the floor and wanted to cry, because nothing hurts and saddens and breaks a helper-elf's heart more than not making a child happy. And sometimes they just can't. Poor Elmer felt so terrible he didn't even want to think about it, and after a few minutes of feeling sad and horrible and not liking himself at all, the tired, exhausted little helper elf nodded off to sleep.
On Christmas morning poor timid Elmer woke up late, not on the warehouse floor where he'd fallen asleep, but in his own proper top bunk-bed bed. Santa held a tray with [N-14] {SPS_3-20} and [P-14] {SPS_3-21} and [Q-14] {SPS_3-22} --- Elmer's favorite breakfast.
"Well, Elmer--" Santa began. Elmer cried now. Ashamed. Ashamed Santa would treat him so nicely after he had failed the children and Santa and Christmas.
"You know," Santa said, "I didn't bring three children the presents they asked for."
Poor sad Elmer sobbed and wailed louder than ever. "[A] {SPS_3-23} says that [R-5,6,7] {SPS_3-24} is boring," Santa said, "and wants nothing to do with, but really, really likes the new [S-5,6,7,10,13] {SPS_3-25} and rides it everywhere...even to the potty."
"And [B] {SPS_3-26} already has an old [V-13] {SPS_3-27} , and won't play with the new one, but really likes the [W-10] {SPS_3-28} which [B] {SPS_3-29} says is now the very favoritest bestest toy of all." "[C] {SPS_3-30} likes her pretty new [X-12,5,6,7,10] {SPS_3-31} well enough, but her mother says she can't take it outside yet. She liked her pink sweater with the [Y-5,6,7] {SPS_3-32} only
okay until everyone said how pretty it is, and now it's almost the only top she ever wants to wear anywhere."
"Ohhhh." Elmer said.
"But--the boss at the shleter said she's sorry, but there's just not enough room and each child can keep only one present."
"Oh....." Elmer said.
"But three new children came to the shelter. They didn't have a home for Santa to visit Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day they found no presents at all."
"Oh!"
"So [A] {SPS_3-33} and [B] {SPS_3-34} and [C] {SPS_3-35} gave their extra gifts to those three children who were very surprised, and very, very happy and excited to get them!"
"Oh!!!"
"And [A] {SPS_3-36} and [B] {SPS_3-37} and [C] {SPS_3-38} discovered what you and I have always known."
"Oh?"
"That getting a gift feels wonderful, but giving to someone who really needs it feels even better."
"Oh." Elmer said. "Ohhhhhh."
.........
"Ohhhhhh"
......
"Ohhh"
