{SPS_4_1} Magical Wheels

Suppose you had a favorite trike or bike or wagon or skateboard or skates or [A-13,10] {SPS_4_2} with wheels. Suppose one night a tricky, magical, mischievous [C-3,1,5,6,7] {SPS_4_3} enchanted the wheels with strange super powers so you could ride anywhere in the whole wide world, or out of the world. Anywhere-- but the special rule is, you must always keep your eyes closed and see everything just with your imagination.
Would you ride to the zoo and visit one of your very favorite animals? Wouldn't it be wonderful to visit a nice [D-3,5,6,7] {SPS_4_4} ! Would you pet it? What would that feel like? What would it smell like? If it was gobbling down piles of [E-14] {SPS_4_5} and offered to share-- would you eat some?
Would you fly up and way over some [G-8,13,15,16] {SPS_4_6} and then far above some big [J-8,13,15,16] {SPS_4_7} and over lots of sea water to a desert island? If your magical wheels glided fast over the sea waves, what would the water spray feel like on your [Ka-4] {SPS_4_8} and [Kb-4] {SPS_4_9} and [Kc-4] {SPS_4_10} ? On the beach would you walk barefoot in warm squishy sand and look for a lost [La-11,12,8,9] {SPS_4_11} washed ashore by the surf and waves, or maybe dig in the sand to find some lost [Lb-11,12,8,9] {SPS_4_12} .
Maybe your wheels would vie you deep under the salty water to watch some lazy [N-6,5,3,1] {SPS_4_13} swim by. Some huge [P-8,9,10,11,12,13] {SPS_4_14} bigger than a bus might float past an octopus swirling its eight arms that never tangle, and a big [Q-6,8,9,10,11,12,13] {SPS_4_15} leap high out of the water and splash back down, and you'd feel the underwater splashy waves on your body--and maybe see a strange sea-[R-3,5,6] {SPS_4_16} .
Your enchanted wheels might fly you so high in the sky that you could feel the cool swirly wind on your [S-4] {SPS_4_17} and your [U-12] {SPS_4_18} might blow away, and you'd float through a cloud shaped like a soft [V-1,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16] {SPS_4_19} or glide through misty damp fog. You could hold out your [W-4] {SPS_4_20} and a little [X-7] {SPS_4_21} flying by could sit there to rest, cock its eye in your direction, and wonder what kind of bird you might be.
Your magical wheels could roll you deep down into underground caves where all around you'd see nothing but rocks shaped like a little [Y-1,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16] {SPS_4_22} or some [Z-1,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16] {SPS_4_23} or a ginormous [AA-1,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16] {SPS_4_24} . You could travel so far back you hear nothing but silence until you pick up two rocks, maybe one kind of [CC-1,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16] {SPS_4_25} -like, another kind of [DD-1,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16] {SPS_4_26} -like, and hit them together to hear the echoes echoes echoes click farther farther farther awaaaaaay.
{SPS_4_27} Would you see any creatures at all in a deep cave? If you had a flashlight maybe you'd see a dark [EE-3,5,6,7] {SPS_4_28} ,or maybe a hiding [GG-3,5,6,7] {SPS_4_29} .
Would you ride far, far back in time and visit the dinosaurs, and maybe bring back a little baby dinosaur [JJ-3,5,6,7] {SPS_4_30} to be your pet? Would you hide it under your bed and secretly feed it some [KK-14] {SPS_4_31} for dinner? Would you ever tell anyone about your strange and wonderful pet dinosaur [JJ] {SPS_4_32} , or just keep it hidden and secret?
If you visited all these places on your ride you might feel awfully tired after a while, and want to imagine riding back home where somebody loves you. And after so many strange and wonderful adventures your last ride home might just be the very best most magical ride of all.
