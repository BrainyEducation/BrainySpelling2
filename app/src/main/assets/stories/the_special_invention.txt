{SPS_2_1} "Get dressed and come to breakfast right now!" Mom called sweetly.
"I will," [A-2] {SPS_2_2} said.
"You said that twice already! You'll make me late for work."
"Okay!" [A] {SPS_2_3} said.
Great ideas kept [A] {SPS_2_4} thinking till late at night, so every morning it was hard to wake up in time for
school. [A] {SPS_2_5} liked inventing things, and they always worked really well—while [A] {SPS_2_6} was planning and imagining them—and sometimes almost worked after [A-2] {SPS_2_7} actually made them.
A funnel to toss toys in like the [B-10] {SPS_2_8} and the [C-10] {SPS_2_9} so they'd slide into the toy box to save time cleaning up. A squirt-gun scraper to scrape dog poop off shoes and wash them at the same time. A special second string so a kite could drop a little parachute
holding a toy [D-3,5,6,7,8,10,11,13]. {SPS_2_10} Interesting inventions. Helpful inventions! Wonderful
inventions!! [A] {SPS_2_11} needed a special stay-up-after-wake-up-in-the-morning
invention. [A] {SPS_2_12} thought about the [E-5,6,7,8,9,10,11] {SPS_2_13} part all through breakfast, and cogitated about the [G-5,6,7,8,9,10,11] {SPS_2_14} section on the way to school, and devised the [J-13] {SPS_2_15} unit at school, and imagined the [K-5,6,7,8,9,10,11] {SPS_2_16} segment on the way home, and by after school snack time knew the [L-5,6,7,8,9,10,11] {SPS_2_17} made the final step and then knew exactly how to create it!
Every morning on her way to the kitchen Mom opened the bedroom door to politely say,
"Wake up!" [A] {SPS_2_18} tied a string to the door knob, so when the door opened it would drop a toy [E] {SPS_2_19} on a teeter-totter lever tossing a toy [G] {SPS_2_20} up in the air to flip over and land in a box on top of a toy [J] {SPS_2_21} that would tip to roll down a ramp and knock loose the [K] {SPS_2_22} hooked to the stopper on an old plastic bottle filled with water that would start slowly trickling into a bucket with its handle rubber-banded to a stick taped to a toy [L] {SPS_2_23} taped to a sharp pin on the end that would swing up to smack and pop a balloon that would for sure startle awake even
sleepy [A]. {SPS_2_24} Who could sleep after creating such a magnificatious, splendificatory, brilliastonishing, phenomitastic invention?! Not [A], {SPS_2_25} not until very late.
Too late. [A] {SPS_2_26} didn't wake up when Mom opened the door and gently suggested, "Wake up!" Didn't notice the toy [E] {SPS_2_27} dropping on the teeter-totter lever that tossed the toy [G] {SPS_2_28} up into the air to flip and land on the [J] {SPS_2_29} so hard that it slipped off the track but still bumped the [K] {SPS_2_30} loose, only smacking the stopper so hard the water didn't trickle out but shot out like a squirt gun and soaked a toy stuffed [N-5,6,7] {SPS_2_31} on the edge of the shelf that got so wet heavy it fell on the cat that startled and screeched and leaped up high and knocked its hindquarters into the [L] {SPS_2_32} so the pin sharp stung the cat's tail and it howled and claw snatched at the balloon that loud-popped scaring the cat to twist land slap on
guess-whose sleeping face. [A] {SPS_2_33} swiped the cat away and jolted straight up and looked at the disrupted contraption—and thought: "Even if everything didn't go exactly perfectly according to plan, my stay-up-after-wake-up-in-the-morning invention worked!" And it did!
