{SPS_5_1} The Space Alien

One Saturday evening [A-2] {SPS_5_2} and [C-2] {SPS_5_3} made a tent to camp out in the back yard. They griped and whined and complained to each other about a school assignment due next week: to stand in front of the whole class and show pictures and talk about a special place they had visited. Neither one had any special pictures of any place special, and they both just knew the teacher would embarrass them, and the other kids would tease them, and Monday would be terrifishously, awfulishously, horrifishously bad. Feeling glum, [A] {SPS_5_4} snuggled tight in some blankets and [C] {SPS_5_5} curled up in a sleeping bag, when about midnight a strange-shaped shadow flickered on their tent wall.
"What's that" asked [A] {SPS_5_6} . "Maybe some [AA-1,2,3,5] {SPS_5_7} ."
"Or maybe some kind of [BB-1,2,3,5] {SPS_5_8} ," guessed [C] {SPS_5_9} .
They stuck their noses outside to find a weird looking space alien just their size.
"Please help me!"
"How?"
"For my school project I need pictures of earth stuff, and I took a few pictures but I need more."
"Show us."
Space Alien punched a shiny elbow button and twisted a fancy shoulder dial, and Space Alien's tummy screen displayed a glowy [CC-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_10} .
"That's a strange looking earth planet [DD-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_11} ."
"Nope. Actually, a pretty nice [CC] {SPS_5_12} ."
"No! Are you sure?"
Both kids nodded yes.
"But my sister said-- I just feel so [FF-18,19] {SPS_5_13} . It makes me want to [GG-18,19] {SPS_5_14} . Well, what about my [HH-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_15} ?"
"Sorry. But you've got a really nice [JJ-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_16} ."
"I'll fail my school project!"
"No way! We'll help."
"What kinds of pictures do you need?"
"Anything! Everything!"
While everyone else in the house slept tight, the kids showed Space Alien lots of things--some toys, some real.
" [KK-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_17} , I'm sure! My big brother told me."
" [LL-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_18} . Big Brother must have been teasing. Guess this."
" [MM-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_19} . Absolutely positively!"
"Nope, [NN-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_20} ."
Then Space Alien started to [OO-17] {SPS_5_21} and [PP-17] {SPS_5_22} .
"Why are you doing that?"
"That's how we show we're confused on my planet."
"We mostly just scratch our heads."
"What do you do when you're angry?"
" [QQ-17] {SPS_5_23} ."
"And when you're happy?"
"Mostly we [RR-17] ."
[A] {SPS_5_24} and [C] {SPS_5_25} just shook their heads.
"Want to ride along while I check out some more freaky strange stuff?"
"Sure!"
Space Alien clicked heels, and a weird unearthly contraption quick-scooted over and hovered in the air beside their ankles.
"What a great skateboard!"
"Fantabulously SUPER skateboard!"
"Space-board!"
All three hopped on and flew away soaring high over a big [SS-16] {SPS_5_26} and an even bigger [TT-16] {SPS_5_27} , curling-cueing around some [UU-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_28} and nearly knocking over an in-the-way [VV-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_29} Space Alien snapped picture after picture, [WW-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_30} and [XX-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_31} and [YY-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_32} and [ZZ-8,9,11,15,16] {SPS_5_33} .
"That's enough. Thanks for helping me do the best school project ever!"
"Glad to help. But you know--"
"What?"
"We've got our own school project due next week."
"About some place we'd like to visit."
"Do you think, maybe--"
"Maybe--"
"I'll be back same time tomorrow night! Bring your cameras!"
And they did!
